Periscope
=========

A static generator for single-page documentation sites.

Most static site generators work really well for blogs and static pages, but what if you want to take a bunch of
individual source files in Markdown or HTML and generate a single, navigable page? Periscope does exactly this. It's
useful if you want to generate single-page documentation sites for open source projects, but aren't a fan of big, 
literate-coding-style codebases.
